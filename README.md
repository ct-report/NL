Contact Tracing - Netherlands

On April 21 the Dutch Cabinet decided not to designate any of the 7 proposals, which had been selected for the National Appathon on April 18-19.

The Dutch Cabinet is now working on a new solution, that can fulfill all the requirements (EPDB/Privacy & Safety).

**First releases of Documentation & Android/iOS early-stage sources for test purposes have already been uploaded to Github.**
