Contact Tracing - Netherlands

![](apkicon_NL.png)

On April 21, 2020 the Dutch Cabinet decided not to designate any of the 7 proposals, which had been selected for the National Appathon on April 18-19.

The Dutch Cabinet decided to work on a new solution, that can fulfill all the requirements (EPDB/Privacy & Safety).

On June 2020 the first releases of Documentation & Android/iOS early-stage sources for test purposes have been uploaded to Github.

**On August 2020 the first release of "CoronaMelder" app has been published on Google Play Store** = decentralized BLE contact tracing app that uses Apple+Google Exposure Notifications API.

**Latest builds are also available on Huawei AppGallery with Apple+Google Exposure Notifications & HMS Contact Shield API support**. HMS Contact Shield API support allows to use the app also with Honor/Huawei GMS uncertified devices.
