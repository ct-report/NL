Contact Tracing - Netherlands

On April 21 the Dutch Cabinet decided not to designate any of the 7 proposals, which had been selected for the Appathon on April 18/19.

The Cabinet is now evaluating the feasibility of a different solution, that can be made under the direction of the State & that meets all the requirements (EPDB/Privacy & Safety).

In the week of May 18, the Cabinet will announce if and how an app will be used to support GGD in tracing and traceability.

\
These are the 7 proposals, that have participated in the National Appathon.
