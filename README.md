Contact Tracing - Netherlands

On April 21 the Dutch Cabinet decided not to designate any of the 7 solutions, which had been selected for the Appathon on April 18/19.

The Cabinet is now evaluating the feasibility of a well-functioning solution, that can be made under the direction of the State & meets all requirements (EPDB/Privacy & Safety).

In the week of May 18, the Cabinet will announce if and how an app will be used to support GGD in tracing and traceability.

These are the 7 proposals, that took part in the Appathon.
